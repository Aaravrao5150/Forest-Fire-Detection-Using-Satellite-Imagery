These fires can spread quickly and cause a lot of damage. So, we want to build a computer program that can look at pictures of forests and tell us if there’s a fire starting or not. This program can help people react faster to stop wildfires!"

By training a CNN model on a dataset of wildfire and non-wildfire images, we developed a system capable of identifying potential fire threats. This technology has the potential to significantly improve wildfire detection and response, contributing to the safety of both people and natural environments."
